# ❄️ devin's nix flake

this is my nix flake for my macbook and server, along with possibly other machines in the future. it's kinda messy and eternally under construction.

## hosts

other hosts may be added in the future. this only includes machines in my flake, for all my devices, see [devins.page/blog/stuff-i-use](https://devins.page/blog/stuff-i-use/).

### bluepill

my home server hosting things like navidrome, jellyfin, backups, etc. runs on my old pc.

### coolbook

my macbook, my main computer. i mostly use homebrew for gui applications if possible, and use nix for cli.
