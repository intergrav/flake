- devins-nixos-pc
  - My workstation. This is where I do mostly everything.
- devins-nixos-laptop
  - My Dell Latitude E6440. I don't use this often, but sometimes I do if I need to or don't want to sit at a desktop. Currently a work in progress, missing the `hardware-configuration.nix` file as I haven't installed NixOS there yet.

I'll probably think of some unique names eventually, but right now they're just simple and generic. I'll also improve the general structure later.
